When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:'

test

```{r}

con <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(),
                      ## Driver = "SQL Server",
                      ##Driver = "{SQL Server Native Client 11.0}",
                      Driver = "{ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server}", # this driver works better; it needs to be installed
                      Server = "TRSQLAG-PTDWP.th.gov.bc.ca",
                      Database = "PTDW_PRD",
                      Trusted_Connection = "yes")


```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{sql, connection=con}
 
select 
*
from 

	[PTDW_PRD].[dbo].[PTDW_ORGANIZATION] c

```
 




```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2

plot(cars)
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
